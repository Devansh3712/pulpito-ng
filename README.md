# pulpito-ng

This is a rewrite of [Pulpito](https://github.com/ceph/pulpito) in React, in
its early stages. Many, but not all, of the original Pulpito's features have
been implemented.

## Getting Started

You'll need at least [node v17](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Once you've got that, start in development mode with:

    $ npm install
    $ npm run start
